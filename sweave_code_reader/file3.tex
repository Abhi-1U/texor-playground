\title{Comparing Least Squares Calculations}
\author{Douglas Bates\\R Development Core Team\\\email{Douglas.Bates@R-project.org}}
\abstract{
  Many statistics methods require one or more least squares problems
  to be solved.  There are several ways to perform this calculation,
  using objects from the base R system and using objects in the
  classes defined in the \code{Matrix} package.

  We compare the speed of some of these methods on a very small
  example and on a example for which the model matrix is large and
  sparse.

When the option OutDec is not \texttt{.}, put numbers in \texttt{\textbackslash{}text}. See \#348.
